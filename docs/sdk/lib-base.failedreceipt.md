## FailedReceipt type

Indicates that the transaction has been mined, but it failed.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare type FailedReceipt<R = unknown> = {
    status: "failed";
    rawReceipt: R;
};
```

## Remarks

The `rawReceipt` property is an implementation-specific transaction receipt object.
